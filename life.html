                <h2>Origin Of Crochet</h2>
                <p>So how long as the art of crochet been around, then? Reality is that the history of crochet can’t narrow down exactly when it was created. According to some historians and researchers, crochet likely developed most directly from Chinese needlework, an ancient form of embroidery known in Turkey, India, Persia and North Africa. <br><br>

                    Crochet has also been noted in the history books to have been first noticed by French nuns in France but is noted that it could be found much earlier such as 1500–1800 BC. Based on the hand technique of crochet, it’s more than likely that it is a Middle Eastern technique that has shifted over time to other civilizations. <br><br>
                     
                    Now, how someone knew to shape the hook and start in the first place is a mystery but what I find more interesting is how it has changed over time to today. <br><br>
                     
                    Back when the nuns were crocheting, they were doing very complex lacing with very fine materials like table clothes. It was considered valuable and something found in churches as part of the decor. They say only the nuns knew how to crochet and was considered part of their work.</p>
